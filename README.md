# SoftwareDesignGuide

Hello there! Here is a hopefully helpful guide for what we have learned in our time in the Software Development course at the University of Minnesota Morris.

## DISCLAIMER 

Everything in this guide is to our knowledge. They are all ideas and concepts we have worked with and would like to give guidance on. There are certainly more areas to explore and it is encouraged that you expand your knowledge beyond this document. 

It is always advisable to ask a professor, a TA, a trusted peer, or another classmate about confusions or other approaches to a problem. As you work with the code and your projects, you will develop a better understanding of the material but it is important to ask questions to better supplement your learning.

In no way is this a substitute for lecture. A non-trivial portion of your education will come from not only attending lectures but also working alongside your classmates. Communication and sharing ideas will be key to not only problem solving but expanding your knowledge as a whole.

Remember to ask your professor if any confusions arise. It is a healthy practice to seek solutions from a variety of sources, when your peers (or even professor(s)) are unable to assist with your inquiries. Be proactive, be the pursuer of your own solutions, but seek advice if you encounter a roadblock.

Again, this is simply a guide to understand the common topics of the course and an introduction to the programming challenges you will encounter.
